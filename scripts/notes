lack of phasing actually makes things easier: can have unlabeled state. the
emission probabilities are for the events that there are 1 or 2 derived
mutations at a position. this emission probability depends only on T3 and T2 in
the three-lineage genealogy, not the (labeled) topology. transitions between
different vectors of (T3, T2) will easy to derive. 

EM algorithm: expectation of the log-likelihood of the observations w.r.t. the
latent variables is achieved by calculating the expected number of transitions
from each state i to each state j. (also need expected probabilities of first
latent variable.) ...
